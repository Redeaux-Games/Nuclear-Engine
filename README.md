### Building
The project has three building configurations:

Debug: Which is used in internal engine development.

Checked: Use it if you are developing a game.

Release: Provides maximum performance, use it if you are publishing your game.


Some Dependencies need to be downloaded and built manually,
we plan to create a completely automated install that will automatically
install the dependencies on your device.

  - DiligentEngine
  - DiligentCore
  - DiligentFX
  - DiligentTools
  - FMOD SDK
  - Nvidia PhysX 4.1
  - Freeimage
  - GLFW 
  - Python 3.6+ (modules)


System Requirements:
  - Intel I5 or higher / AMD Ryzen 5 or higher
  - 8gb of ram or higher
  - At least 25gb of disk space or more
  - Nvidia gtx 1050 or higher / AMD Radeon 560 or higher
  - Raytracing will require a Nvidia RTX gpu

We plan on getting the core features installed with 
an installers only around 600 to 700 megabytes, 
everything is modular. We plan on releasing for Windows,
